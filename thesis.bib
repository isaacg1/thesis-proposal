abstract="The M/G/K queueing system is one of the oldest models for multiserver systems and has been the topic of performance papers for almost half a century. However, even now, only coarse approximations exist for its mean waiting time. All the closed-form (nonnumerical) approximations in the literature are based on (at most) the first two moments of the job size distribution. In this paper we prove that no approximation based on only the first two moments can be accurate for all job size distributions, and we provide a lower bound on the inapproximability ratio, which we refer to as ``the gap.'' This is the first such result in the literature to address ``the gap.'' The proof technique behind this result is novel as well and combines mean value analysis, sample path techniques, scheduling, regenerative arguments, and asymptotic estimates. Finally, our work provides insight into the effect of higher moments of the job size distribution on the mean waiting time.",

abstract = "The Shortest Remaining Processing Time (SRPT) scheduling policy and its variants have been extensively studied in both theoretical and practical settings. While beautiful results are known for single-server SRPT, much less is known for multiserver SRPT. In particular, stochastic analysis of the M/G/k under SRPT is entirely open. Intuition suggests that multiserver SRPT should be optimal or near-optimal for minimizing mean response time. However, the only known analysis of multiserver SRPT is in the worst-case adversarial setting, where SRPT can be far from optimal. In this paper, we give the first stochastic analysis bounding mean response time of the M/G/k under SRPT. Using our response time bound, we show that multiserver SRPT has asymptotically optimal mean response time in the heavy-traffic limit. The key to our bounds is a strategic combination of stochastic and worst-case techniques. Beyond SRPT, we prove similar response time bounds and optimality results for several other multiserver scheduling policies."

We use the martingale method to prove that a scaled process counting the number of idle servers and queues of length exactly two weakly converges to a two-dimensional reflected Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, while processes counting longer queues converge to a deterministic system decaying to zero in constant time. This limiting system is comparable to that of the traditional Halfin-Whitt model, but there are key differences in the queueing behavior of the JSQ model. In particular, only a vanishing fraction of customers will have to wait, but those who do incur a constant order waiting time. }

    abstract = { Consider a queueing system with two or more servers, each with its own queue with infinite capacity. Customers arrive according to some stochastic process (e.g., a Poisson process) and immediately upon arrival must join one of the queues, thereafter to be served on a first-come first-served basis, with no jockeying or defections allowed. The service times are independent and identically distributed with a known distribution. Moreover, the service times are independent of the arrival process and the customer decisions. The only information about the history of the system available for deciding which queue to join is the number of customers currently waiting and being served at each server. Joining the shortest queue is known to minimize each customer's individual expected delay and the long-run average delay per customer when the service-time distribution is exponential or has nondecreasing failure rate. We show that there are service-time distributions for which it is not optimal to always join the shortest queue. We also show that if, in addition, the elapsed service times of customers in service are known, the long-run average delay is not always minimized by customers joining the queue that minimizes their individual expected delays. }

abstract="This paper studies dynamic routing in a parallel server queueing network with a single Poisson arrival process and two servers with exponential processing times of different rates. Each customer must be routed at the time of arrival to one of the two queues in the network. We establish that this system operating under a threshold policy can be well approximated by a one-dimensional reflected Brownian motion when the arrival rate to the network is close to the processing capacity of the two servers. As the heavy traffic limit is approached, thresholds which grow at a logarithmic rate are critical in determining the behavior of the limiting system. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions on the growth rate of the threshold for (i) approximation of the network by a reflected Brownian motion (ii) positive recurrence of the limiting Brownian diffusion and (iii) asymptotic optimality of the threshold policy.",
